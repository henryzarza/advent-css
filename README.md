# Brief

For 24 days, I received an email outlining a CSS challenge.
Each challenge includes:

All the assets I needed to get started, including a [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) design file (if you don't have a Figma account, don't worry it's FREE)
A brief on how to get started, with ideas to test yourself, and FAQs.

I suscribed to challenge in this [URL](https://www.adventofcss.com/)

On my [personal page](https://henryzarza.vercel.app/) I posted all of the challenges photos
